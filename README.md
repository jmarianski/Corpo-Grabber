# Corpo-Grabber
Utility web page for grabbing text corpora from the internet and stores them.

Currently you can download entire site with "advanced download". "Load" function allows applying filters to downloaded sites.

It will work (or is working) like that:

1) You download site

2) You load project

3) You're presented with visual representation of site. 

4) You're tasked with defining elements, that you'd like to extract. 

5) When you define them, you then select text elements that best describe desired element. 

6) When you select them, the exact pattern will be saved and it will be applied to other subsites

7) After all of the sites have been parsed with the pattern, the site is saved to desired format (CCL)

7a) If there are problems with pattern on particular sites (because they have different structures) you're presented with a choise: skip site or modify pattern for remaining sites

TODO by now:

1) Presenting site structure in form of a tree

2) Allowing marking of tree branches to use as chunks

3) Saving to CCL format

4) Using Morfeusz dictionary for word annotations


This is a project for master thesis. If you'd like to contribute, please acknowledge me with sources you've used to manipulate the code. If you'd like to request a feature, please use the apropriate option on github.

Thank you and have a nice day!
