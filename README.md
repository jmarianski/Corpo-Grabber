# Corpo-Grabber
Utility web page for grabbing text corpora from the internet and stores them.

Currently with this tool you can download any web page and view any of the potential text chunks you can extract. With that in mind, you can select usable chunks and save them yourself into your desired text corpora format.

TODO in the future (in order of most propable appearance):

1) Select number of words that have to be present in raw chunk to be considered as text corpora chunk.

2) Saving to CCL format

3) Using Morfeusz dictionary for word annotations

4) Self-made annotations to words, sentences and chunks

This is a project for master thesis. If you'd like to contribute, please acknowledge me with sources you've used to manipulate the code. If you'd like to request a feature, please use the apropriate option on github.

Thank you and have a nice day!
